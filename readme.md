### Lab/Homework

#### Instructions
Model a tech company, featuring managers, developers db admins and directors.
Do so according to the spec, paying particular attention to access priviliges and packages.

See instructions.md

#### Notes

* Remember that when dealing with inheritance, the search for methods/variables is upward and the first match is taken.

* Remember to test in all files before creating the function, you should test git code git repeat.

* Classes need to start with a capital letter, if you're getting a static type error it means that you've accidentally created a class method . Static methods are class methods.

* Do the right thing.
